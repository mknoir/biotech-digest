  arXiv:2509.00524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models capture pathway-pathway interactions, bu…
