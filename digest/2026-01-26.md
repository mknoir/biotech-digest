## Endpoints News

- **[Genmab halts enrollment for cancer drug from ProfoundBio buyout](https://endpoints.news/genmab-halts-enrollment-for-cancer-drug-from-profoundbio-buyout/)**  
  _Mon, 26 Jan 2026 11:31:04 +0000_  
  Genmab has stopped enrolling patients for an early-stage trial of a cancer candidate it obtained in its $1.8 billion acquisition of US-China biotech ProfoundBio.

 The Phase 1/2 study of GEN1286 was meant to enroll 260 ...

  _Jan 26, 2026 9:01am_  
  AstraZeneca is showing no signs of restarting a 200 million pound sterling ($273 million) investment in its hometown, despite keeping its options open.

  _Jan 26, 2026 7:48am_  
  Guardant Health snagged the FDA green light to use its Guardant360 CDx colon cancer diagnostic along with Pfizer’s drug Braftovi in combination with cetuximab and chemotherapy.

  _Jan 23, 2026 8:38am_  
  Despite remaining a fertile hunting ground for Big Pharmas to snap up biotechs or license new therapies, the U.K. hasn’t produced any new publicly listed drug developers of its own for many years.

- **[Modeling tumor progression in heterogeneous microenvironments: A cellular automata approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16384)**  
  _Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2601.16384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how microenvironmental heterogeneity influences tumor progression is essential for advancing both cancer biology and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we develop a cellular automata (CA) model to simulate tumor growth under varying microenvironmental…

- **[Adaptive dynamics of eco-evolutionary repeated games: Effect of reward and punishment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16593)**  
  _Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2601.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term evolutionary processes can strongly influence common-pool resource conservation by generating new traits or behaviours that modify the feedback between population strategies and the resource state. Here we develop an eco-evolutionary framework in which individ…

- **[Cognitively-Inspired Tokens Overcome Egocentric Bias in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16378)**  
  _Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2601.16378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning that requires adopting another agent's visual perspective. These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models…

- **[Ultrafast topological data analysis reveals pandemic-scale dynamics of convergent evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07292)**  
  _Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2106.07292v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genome variants which re-occur independently across evolutionary lineages are key molecular signatures of adaptation. Inferring the dynamics of such genetic changes from pandemic-scale genomic datasets is now possible, which opens up unprecedented insight into evolu…

- **[Simultaneity of consciousness with physical reality: the key that unlocks the mind-matter problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15566)**  
  _Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2309.15566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of explaining the relationship between subjective experience and physical reality remains difficult and unresolved. In most explanations, consciousness is epiphenomenal, without causal power. The most notable exception is Integrated Information Theory (I…

- **[A mathematical framework to study organising principles in graphical representations of biochemical processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18024)**  
  _Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2410.18024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity of molecular and cellular processes forces experimental studies to focus on subsystems. To study the functioning of biological systems across levels of structural and functional organisation, we require tools to compose and organise networks with diff…

- **[State Space Models Naturally Produce Time Cell and Oscillatory Behaviors and Scale to Abstract Cognitive Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13638)**  
  _Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2507.13638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A grand challenge in modern neuroscience is to bridge the gap between the detailed mapping of microscale neural circuits and mechanistic understanding of cognitive functions. While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal connectivity and biophysics, how these low-…

- **[Optimizing information transmission in optogenetic Wnt signaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22633)**  
  _Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2506.22633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Populations of cells regulate gene expression in response to external signals, but their ability to make reliable collective decisions is limited by both intrinsic noise in molecular signaling and variability between individual cells. In this work, we use opto…
