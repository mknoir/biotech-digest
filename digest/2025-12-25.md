- **[Computational optimisation of slow cooling profiles for the cryopreservation of cells in suspension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20805)**  
  _Thu, 25 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.20805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cryopreservation of biological materials is a highly complex process, as it involves numerous factors such as the cooling and thawing procedures, the administration of cryoprotective agents (CPAs), as well as the type and composition of cells. While theoretical work…

- **[Using stationary information flows to prove kinetic uncertainty relations in biochemical control systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20887)**  
  _Thu, 25 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.20887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many cellular components are present in such low numbers that individual stochastic production and degradation events lead to significant fluctuations in molecular abundances. Although feedback control can, in principle, suppress such low-copy-number fluctuations, gener…

- **[Clever Hans in Chemistry: Chemist Style Signals Confound Activity Prediction on Public Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20924)**  
  _Thu, 25 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.20924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can machine learning models identify which chemist made a molecule from structure alone? If so, models trained on literature data may exploit chemist intent rather than learning causal structure-activity relationships. We test this by linking CHEMBL assays to publicatio…

- **[Decoding Predictive Inference in Visual Language Processing via Spatiotemporal Neural Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20929)**  
  _Thu, 25 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.20929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human language processing relies on the brain's capacity for predictive inference. We present a machine learning framework for decoding neural (EEG) responses to dynamic visual language stimuli in Deaf signers. Using coherence between neural signals and optical flow-der…

- **[Active inference and artificial reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21129)**  
  _Thu, 25 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.21129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or…

- **[An Allele-Centric Pan-Graph-Matrix Representation for Scalable Pangenome Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21320)**  
  _Thu, 25 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.21320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population-scale pangenome analysis increasingly requires representations that unify single-nucleotide and structural variation while remaining scalable across large cohorts. Existing formats are typically sequence-centric, path-centric, or sample-centric, and often obs…

- **[Transcriptome-Conditioned Personalized De Novo Drug Generation for AML Using Metaheuristic Assembly and Target-Driven Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21301)**  
  _Thu, 25 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.21301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) remains a clinical challenge due to its extreme molecular heterogeneity and high relapse rates. While precision medicine has introduced mutation-specific therapies, many patients still lack effective, personalized options. This paper prese…

- **[Gradient Diffusion: Sensitivity-Matrix Co-Simulation Enables Activity Adaptation and Learnable Plasticity in Neural Simulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07327)**  
  _Thu, 25 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2412.07327v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational neuroscience relies on large-scale dynamical-systems models of neurons, with a vast amount of offline, pre-simulation, tuned parameters, with models often tied to their brain simulators. These fixed parameters lead to stiff models, that show unnatural…

- **[Aging health dynamics cross a tipping point near age 75](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07795)**  
  _Thu, 25 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2412.07795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aging includes both continuous gradual decline from microscopic mechanisms together with major deficit onset events such as morbidity, disability and ultimately death. These deficit events are stochastic, obscuring the connection between aging mechanisms and overall…

- **[Hillclimb-Causal Inference: A Data-Driven Approach to Identify Causal Pathways Among Parental Behaviors, Genetic Risk, and Externalizing Behaviors in Children](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06784)**  
  _Thu, 25 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2505.06784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: Externalizing behaviors in children, such as aggression, hyperactivity, and defiance, are influenced by complex interplays between genetic predispositions and environmental factors, particularly parental behaviors. Unraveling these intricate causal relat…

- **[EEG Foundation Models: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11783)**  
  _Thu, 25 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2507.11783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Premise. Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive…
