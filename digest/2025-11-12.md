  _Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2511.07825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human cooperation depends on how accurately we infer others' motives--how much they value fairness, generosity, or self-interest from the choices they make. We model that process in binary dictator games, which isolate moral trade-offs between self and other stripped of…

  arXiv:2511.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly all cell models explicitly or implicitly deal with the biophysical constraints that must be respected for life to persist. Despite this, there is almost no systematicity in how these constraints are implemented, and we lack a principled understanding of how cellu…
