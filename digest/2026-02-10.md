  _Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2602.08213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecule generation and optimization is a fundamental task in chemical domain. The rapid development of intelligent tools, especially large language models (LLMs) with powerful knowledge reserves and interactive capabilities, has provided new paradigms for it. Neverth…

  _Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2602.08751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current biological AI models lack interpretability -- their internal representations do not correspond to biological relationships that
  researchers can examine. Here we present CDT-II, an "AI microscope" whose attention maps are directly interpretable as regulatory…

  _Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2602.08910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional connectivity estimates are highly sensitive to analysis choices and can be dominated by noise when the number of sampled time points is small relative to network dimensionality. This issue is particularly acute in fMRI, where scan resolution is limited. Bec…

- **[Task-Conditioned Probing Reveals Brain-Alignment Patterns in Instruction-Tuned Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08277)**  
  _Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2506.08277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain alignment compared to unimodal models. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal (IT) models have been shown to generate t…

  _Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2508.04747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell type annotation is a fundamental step in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In practice, human experts often rely on the structure revealed by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) graph construct…

  arXiv:2601.19002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Single-stranded whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (ssWGBS) enables DNA methylation profiling in low-input and highly fragmented material, including cell-free DNA. In widely used post-bisulfite protocols, Adaptase-mediated tailing adds stochastic, templat…

  arXiv:2501.17207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph deep learning models, a class of AI-driven approaches employing a message aggregation mechanism, have gained popularity for analyzing the functional brain connectome in neuroimaging. However, their actual effectiveness remains unclear. In this study, we…

  arXiv:2508.16650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain tumour imaging assessment typically requires both pre- and post-contrast MRI, but gadolinium administration is not always desirable, such as in frequent follow-up, renal impairment, allergy, or paediatric patients. We aimed to develop and validate a deep…
