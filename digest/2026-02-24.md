Abstract: Population size is a key metric for management and conservation. This is especially true for large carnivore populations for which management decisions are often based on population size estimates. In France, gray wolves (Canis lupus) have been monitored for more th…

  arXiv:2511.03073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary analyses of large populations commonly incorporate stochasticity through temporal variation in selection while treating genetic transmission as fixed. Much less attention has been given to stochasticity in transmission itself. We study a selected locus…

Abstract: Bacterial chemotactic sensing converts noisy chemical signals into running and tumbling. We analyze the static sensing limits of mixed Tar/Tsr chemoreceptor clusters in individual Escherichia coli cells using a heterogeneous Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model. By swee…

  arXiv:2501.10471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering large high-dimensional datasets with diverse variable is essential for extracting high-level latent information from these datasets. Here, we developed an unsupervised clustering algorithm, we call "Village-Net". Village-Net is specifically designed…

  arXiv:2506.05643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria form networks that range from highly fused interconnected structures to fragmented populations of individual organelles that undergo transient interactions. These structures can be described as temporal networks of physical un…
