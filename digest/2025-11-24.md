- **[A model for mosquito-borne epidemic outbreaks with information-dependent protective behaviour](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16802)**  
  _Mon, 24 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2511.16802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model for a mosquito-borne epidemic outbreak in which humans can adopt protective behaviour against vector bites depending on information on the past and present prevalence. Assuming that mosquitoes can also feed on other non-competent hosts (i.e. hosts that…

- **[Survival and invasion dynamics in cell populations: an analytical framework for threshold behaviour in nonlinear age-structured models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17279)**  
  _Mon, 24 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2511.17279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell populations invade through a combination of proliferation and motility. Proliferation depends on the internal timing of cell division: how long cells take to complete the cell cycle. This timing varies substantially within (and across) cell types, creating age stru…

- **[Local equations for the generalized Lotka-Volterra model on sparse asymmetric graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17499)**  
  _Mon, 24 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2511.17499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real ecosystems are characterized by sparse and asymmetric interactions, posing a major challenge to theoretical analysis. We introduce a new method to study the generalized Lotka-Volterra model with stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs. By deriving local Fokker-Planck…

- **[The Joint Gromov Wasserstein Objective for Multiple Object Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16868)**  
  _Mon, 24 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2511.16868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance serves as a powerful tool for matching objects in metric spaces. However, its traditional formulation is constrained to pairwise matching between single objects, limiting its utility in scenarios and applications requiring multiple…

- **[Double-Profile Intersection (DoPIo) Ultrasound: Pointwise Shear Elasticity Estimation using Paired Confocal Displacement Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16878)**  
  _Mon, 24 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2511.16878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current acoustic radiation force (ARF) based methods for quantifying tissue elasticity primarily rely on shear wave propagation. However, their spatial resolution is limited by the need for spatial averaging, and their accuracy is affected by shear wave guidance, out…

  arXiv:2511.16923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables transcriptomic profiling at cellular resolution but suffers from pervasive dropout events that obscure biological signals. We present SCR-MF, a modular two-stage workflow that combines principled dropout detection using s…

- **[A novel approach to classification of ECG arrhythmia types with latent ODEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16933)**  
  _Mon, 24 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2511.16933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 12-lead ECGs with high sampling frequency are the clinical gold standard for arrhythmia detection, but their short-term, spot-check nature often misses intermittent events. Wearable ECGs enable long-term monitoring but suffer from irregular, lower sampling frequencies…

- **[Approximating a gene regulatory network from non-sequential data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11858)**  
  _Mon, 24 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2401.11858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given non-sequential snapshots from instances of a dynamical system, we design a compressed sensing based algorithm that reconstructs the dynamical system. On the theoretical side, we show that: (1) successful reconstruction is possible under the assumption that we…

- **[Reassessing prediction in the brain: Pre-onset neural encoding during natural listening does not reflect pre-activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19622)**  
  _Mon, 24 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2412.19622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictive processing theories propose that the brain continuously anticipates upcoming input. However, direct neural evidence for predictive pre-activation during natural language comprehension remains limited and debated. Previous studies using large language mode…

  arXiv:2507.06337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background - Pulmonary insufficiency is a consequence of transannular patch repair in Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), leading to late morbidity and mortality. Transcatheter native outflow tract pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) has become common, but assessment of patie…
