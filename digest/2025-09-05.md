  arXiv:2509.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All parts of the hawthorn tree (Crataegus spp.), including fruits, flowers, and leaves, have been used as a source of bioactive compounds. Thus, in this investigation, the twigs of two species of hawthorn plant of Crataegus azarolus (C. azarolus) and Crataegus monogyna…

  arXiv:2509.03681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) detects geometric structure in biological data. However, many TDA algorithms are memory intensive and impractical for massive datasets. Here, we introduce a statistical protocol that reduces TDA's memory requirements and gives access to s…

- **[Nanometer-precision tracking of adipocyte dynamics via single lipid droplet whispering-gallery optical resonances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04201)**  
  _Fri, 05 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400_  
  arXiv:2509.04201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biophotonics-and more recently, biointegrated photonics-offer transformative tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators-optical microcavities formed in spherical structures-have emerged as p…

- **[T-cell receptor specificity landscape revealed through de novo peptide design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00648)**  
  _Fri, 05 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400_  
  arXiv:2503.00648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: T-cells play a key role in adaptive immunity by mounting specific responses against diverse pathogens. An effective binding between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and pathogen-derived peptides presented on Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHCs) mediate an immune respons…
