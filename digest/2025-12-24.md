  _Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.19939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA molecules are known to form complex secondary structures including pseudoknots. A systematic framework for the enumeration, classification and prediction of secondary structures is critical to determine the biological significance of the molecular configurations of…

  _Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.20044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most computational accounts of cognitive maps assume that stability is achieved primarily through sensory anchoring, with self-motion contributing to incremental positional updates only. However, biological spatial representations often remain coherent even when sensory…

- **[Drug-like antibodies with low immunogenicity in human panels designed with Latent-X2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20263)**  
  _Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.20263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug discovery has long sought computational systems capable of designing drug-like molecules directly: developable and non-immunogenic from the start. Here we introduce Latent-X2, a frontier generative model that achieves this goal through zero-shot design of antibodie…

- **[Deep Learning Classification of EEG Responses to Multi-Dimensional Transcranial Electrical Stimulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20319)**  
  _Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.20319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major shortcoming of medical practice is the lack of an objective measure of conscious level. Impairment of consciousness is common, e.g. following brain injury and seizures, which can also interfere with sensory processing and volitional responses. This is also an im…

  arXiv:2512.20481v1 Announce Type: new
