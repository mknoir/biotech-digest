- **[Tree rearrangement graphs admit paths of decreasing Robinson-Foulds distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21397)**  
  _Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.21397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree rearrangements such as Nearest Neighbor Interchange (NNI) and Subtree Prune and Regraft (SPR) are commonly used to explore phylogenetic treespace. Computing distances based on them, however, is often intractable, so the efficiently computable Robinson-Foulds (RF) d…

  _Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.21408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digitization of biological specimens has revolutionized the field of morphology, creating large collections of 3D data, and microCT in particular. This revolution was initially supported by the development of open-source software tools, specifically the development…

  arXiv:2512.21659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models typically neglect metabolic constraints, treating neurons as energetically unconstrained components. We bridge this gap by implementing a conductance-based leaky integrate-and-fire (gLIF) microcircuit (N=5,000) in Brian2, usi…

- **[Phylogenetics in a warm place: computational aspects of the Tropical Grassmannian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21765)**  
  _Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.21765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees provide a fundamental representation of evolutionary relationships, yet the combinatorial explosion of possible tree topologies renders inference computationally challenging. Classical approaches to characterizing tree space, such as the Billera-Holme…

- **[Numerical Twin with Two Dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck Processes of Transient Oscillations in EEG signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21768)**  
  _Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.21768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic burst-like oscillations are common in physiological signals, yet there are few compact generative models that capture their transient structure. We propose a numerical-twin framework that represents transient narrowband activity as a two-dimensional Ornstein-…

- **[Drug discovery guided by maximum drug likeness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21895)**  
  _Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.21895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To overcome the high attrition rate and limited clinical translatability in drug discovery, we introduce the concept of Maximum Drug-Likeness (MDL) and develop an applicable Fivefold MDL strategy (5F-MDL) to reshape the screening paradigm. The 5F-MDL strategy integrates…

  _Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.21952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fungal infections, such as Coccidioidomycosis, Aspergillosis, and Histoplasmosis, represent a growing public health concern in the United States. The rising incidence of these mycoses is linked to climate shifts, demographic changes, and social determinants of health. H…

- **[Sample volume as a key design parameter in affinity-based biosensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21997)**  
  _Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.21997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affinity-based biosensors have become indispensable in modern diagnostics and health monitoring. While considerable research has focused on optimizing analyte transport and binding kinetics, a fundamental parameter - sample volume - remains largely underexplored in bios…

- **[Learning continually with representational drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22045)**  
  _Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.22045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep artificial neural networks famously struggle to learn from non-stationary streams of data. Without dedicated mitigation strategies, continual learning is associated with continuous forgetting of previous tasks and a progressive loss of plasticity. Current approache…

- **[Democratizing Drug Discovery with an Orchestrated, Knowledge-Driven Multi-Agent Team for User-Guided Therapeutic Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21623)**  
  _Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.21623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Therapeutic discovery remains a formidable challenge, impeded by the fragmentation of specialized domains and the execution gap between computational design and physiological validation. Although generative AI offers promise, current models often function as passive a…

  _Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2512.21881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discar…
