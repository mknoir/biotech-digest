  arXiv:2407.12051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA sequences encode critical genetic information, yet their variable length and discrete nature impede direct utilization in deep learning models. Existing DNA representation schemes convert sequences into numerical vectors but fail to capture structural features o…

  _Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2509.16661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As epithelial development or wound closure approaches completion, cell proliferation progressively slows via contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) - a mechanism understood as being strictly local. Here we report the discovery of inhibition of proliferation throu…

  arXiv:2402.15480v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From falcons spotting preys to humans recognizing faces, rapid visual abilities depend on a foveated retinal organization which delivers high-acuity central vision while preserving low-resolution periphery. This organization is conserved along early visual pat…

  arXiv:2411.12232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-component reaction-diffusion system that has previously been developed to model invasion of cells into a resident cell population. The system is an idealised version of models of tumour growth in which tumour cells degrade the surrounding tis…
