  arXiv:2402.07242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing consensus among neuroscientists that neural circuits critical for survival are the result of genomic decompression processes. We introduce SynaptoGen, a novel computational framework--member of the Connectome Models family--bringing synthetic…

  arXiv:2403.03726v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein sequence design has seen significant advances through discrete diffusion and autoregressive approaches, yet the potential of continuous diffusion remains underexplored. Here, we present DiMA, a latent diffusion framework that operates on protein langua…

  _Tue, 09 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400_  
  arXiv:2412.12134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the complex dynamics and fractal attractors that arise in a 60-dimensional ring lattice system of electrically coupled nonchaotic Rulkov neurons. While networks of chaotic Rulkov neurons have been widely studied, systems of nonchaotic R…

  _Tue, 09 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400_  
  arXiv:2502.13729v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured state-space models (SSMs) have been developed to offer more persistent memory retention than traditional recurrent neural networks, while maintaining real-time inference capabilities and addressing the time-complexity limitations of Transformers. De…

- **[Transforming Hyperspectral Images Into Chemical Maps: A Novel End-to-End Deep Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14131)**  
  _Tue, 09 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400_  
  arXiv:2504.14131v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current approaches to chemical map generation from hyperspectral images are based on models such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, generating pixel-wise predictions that do not consider spatial context and suffer from a high degree of noise. This stud…

  _Tue, 09 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400_  
  arXiv:2507.07032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein structure prediction often hinges on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), which underperform on low-homology and orphan proteins. We introduce PLAME, a lightweight MSA design framework that leverages evolutionary embeddings from pretrained protein lang…

- **[Dominant vertices and attractors' landscape for Boolean networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03654)**  
  _Tue, 09 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400_  
  arXiv:2509.03654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous works, we introduced the notion of dominant vertices. This is a set of nodes in the underlying network whose evolution determines the whole network's dynamics after a transient time. In this paper, we focus on the case of Boolean networks. We defin…
