  arXiv:2508.20130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CRISPR-based genome editing has revolutionized biotechnology, yet optimizing guide RNA (gRNA) design for efficiency and safety remains a critical challenge. Recent advances (2020--2025, updated to reflect current year if needed) demonstrate that artificial intelligence…

- **[Ising energy model for the stochastic prediction of tumor islets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20804)**

  arXiv:2508.20804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in diagnosing and treating cancer is the infiltrative growth of tumors into surrounding tissues.
  This microscopic spread of the disease is invisible on most diagnostic imaging modalities and can often only be detected histologically in biopsies.…

- **[Possible Principles for Aligned Structure Learning Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00258)**  
  _Fri, 29 Aug 2025 00:00:00 -0400_  
  arXiv:2410.00258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper offers a roadmap for the development of scalable aligned artificial intelligence (AI) from first principle descriptions of natural intelligence. In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a go…
