- **[AI-Driven Drug Repurposing through miRNA-mRNA Relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03336)**  
  _Thu, 04 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400_  
  arXiv:2509.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: miRNA mRNA relations are closely linked to several biological processes and disease mechanisms In a recent study we tested the performance of large language models LLMs on extracting miRNA mRNA relations from PubMed PubMedBERT achieved the best performance of 0.783 F1 s…

- **[Dynamics of Infection Spread and Hotspot Growth in Bi-Pathogen Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03374)**  
  _Thu, 04 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400_  
  arXiv:2509.03374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal evolution of epidemics with multiple pathogens requires not only new theoretical models but also careful analysis of their practical consequences. Building on the Multiplex Bi-Virus Reaction-Diffusion framework (MBRD) introduced in ou…

- **[Machine Learning-Enhanced Colorimetric Sensing: Achieving over 5700-fold Accuracy Improvement via Full-Spectrum Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03398)**  
  _Thu, 04 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400_  
  arXiv:2509.03398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional colorimetric sensing methods typically rely on signal intensity at a single wavelength, often selected heuristically based on peak visual modulation. This approach overlooks the structured information embedded in full-spectrum transmission profiles, parti…

- **[SafeProtein: Red-Teaming Framework and Benchmark for Protein Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03487)**  
  _Thu, 04 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400_  
  arXiv:2509.03487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding and design. However, the lack of systematic…
