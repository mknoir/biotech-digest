  arXiv:2408.16347v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: This work presents a new computational framework to assist neurophysiologists in Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) analysis, with the goal of improving the definition of the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Methods…

  arXiv:2505.00316v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due to the explicit modeling of intera…

  arXiv:2505.14125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological brains learn continually from a stream of unlabeled data, while integrating specialized information from sparsely labeled examples without compromising their ability to generalize. Meanwhile, machine learning methods are susceptible to catastrophic…

  _Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2509.01806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited sites provide a simple framework for modeling the displacements of animals and humans. When the lattice contains a few impurities or resource sites where the walker spends more time on…
