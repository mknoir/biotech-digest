  arXiv:2407.11498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems operate out of equilibrium, continuously consuming energy to sustain organised, functional states. Their emergent behaviour usually relies on a set of interconnected chemical reaction networks (CRNs) driven by external fluxes that keep some spec…

  arXiv:2503.23189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent loc…

  _Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2509.14053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music is a structured and perceptually rich sequence of sounds in time with well-defined symbolic features, whose perception is shaped by the interplay of expectation and uncertainty. Network science offers a powerful framework for studying its structural orga…

  _Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2509.15748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field responses computed in the earliest l…

  _Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2511.06356v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction prediction remains a fundamental challenge in organic chemistry, where existing machine learning models face two critical limitations: sensitivity to input permutations (molecule/atom orderings) and inadequate modeling of substructural intera…
