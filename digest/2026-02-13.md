  _Fri, 13 Feb 2026 00:00:00 -0500_  
  arXiv:2409.17525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spoken language is often, if not always, understood in a context formed by the identity of the speaker. For example, we can easily make sense of an utterance such as "I'm going to have a manicure this weekend" or "The first time I got pregnant I had a hard time" whe…

  arXiv:2602.08840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do social animals make effective decisions in the absence of a leader? While coordination can improve accuracy, it also introduces delays as information propagates through the group. In changing environments, these delays can outweigh the benefits of globally co…
