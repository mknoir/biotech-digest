  arXiv:2410.17006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bioacoustics data from Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) poses a unique set of challenges for classification, particularly the limited availability of complete and reliable labels in datasets due to annotation uncertainty, biological complexity due the heterog…

  arXiv:2504.21344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have utilized semantic features, deep features, or both to assess lung nodule malignancy. However, their reliance on manual annotation during inference, limited interpretability, and sensitivity to imaging variations hinder their applic…

  arXiv:2505.21900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems maintain stable internal states despite environmental fluctuations. Absolute concentration robustness (ACR) is a striking homeostatic phenomenon in which the steady-state concentration of a species remains invariant despite changes in total supp…

  arXiv:2508.12260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infectious disease forecasting in novel outbreaks or low-resource settings is hampered by the need for disease-specific data, bespoke training, and expert tuning. We introduce Mantis, a foundation model trained entirely on mechanistic simulations, which enable…
